        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Design System project was initiated to address inconsistencies across our product suite and to create a scalable solution for future growth. Our goal was to establish a cohesive design language that would streamline the development process and enhance the user experience across all platforms.</p>

    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Prior to implementing the design system, the user experience was fragmented due to varying design elements, inconsistent UI patterns, and lack of standardization. This resulted in longer development times, higher maintenance costs, and a less intuitive user experience.</p>

                <h4>Research & Discovery</h4>
                <p>We conducted an audit of existing UI elements, interviewed stakeholders, and analyzed user feedback to identify inconsistencies and pain points. The research revealed the need for a unified design system that could be easily adopted across teams.</p>

                <h4>Component Creation & Documentation</h4>
                <p>Based on our findings, we developed a comprehensive design system, including UI components, guidelines, and documentation. We iterated on each component to ensure it was flexible enough to meet various use cases while maintaining consistency.</p>

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>The design system we created included a library of reusable components, a standardized set of design principles, and comprehensive documentation. This solution allowed for a more efficient design-to-development handoff, reduced redundancy, and ensured a consistent user experience across all platforms.</p>
