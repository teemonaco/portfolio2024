        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This case study focuses on addressing a significant issue that affected users on older devices running macOS Mojave or later. The problem was traced back to a minify script that was overcorrecting a previous fix, causing Ajax requests to fail. Our goal was to ensure seamless functionality across all devices, regardless of their age or operating system.</p>

    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>We discovered that a portion of our user base was experiencing issues with Ajax-based functionality, particularly during the checkout process. The issue was more prevalent among users on older devices running macOS Mojave or later. Our initial analysis revealed that the problem stemmed from our minify script, which was overcorrecting code that was specifically meant to accommodate older devices. This led to broken functionality and a poor user experience for a significant segment of our users.</p>

                <h4>Identifying the Issue</h4>
                <p>We began by analyzing user inquiries and crash reports, which indicated a pattern among users on older Apple devices. By using BrowserStack, we replicated the issue and identified the specific script that was causing the problem. We also reviewed previous fixes that were implemented to accommodate older devices, which helped us understand how the minify script was interfering with those accommodations.</p>

                <h4>Code Review & Testing</h4>
                <p>Our next step was to conduct a thorough code review, focusing on the minify script and the affected portions of our codebase. We tested various scenarios, including different operating systems and browser versions, to ensure we identified all instances of the problem. This process involved close collaboration with our development team to iterate on the fix and ensure it addressed the root cause without introducing new issues.</p>

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>We implemented a refined fix that addressed the overcorrection issue in the minify script. The solution involved updating our script to recognize and correctly handle the specific needs of older devices running macOS Mojave or later. Additionally, we adjusted our testing process to include more comprehensive scenarios for older operating systems, ensuring that future updates would not inadvertently disrupt functionality for these users.</p>
