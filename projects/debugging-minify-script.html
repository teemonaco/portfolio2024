            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This case study focuses on the process of identifying and resolving issues caused by the minification script that led to code compatibility problems on older devices. The primary objective was to ensure consistent behavior across all user environments.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Problem Section -->
        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Users with older devices (running macOS Mojave and earlier iOS versions) were experiencing functionality issues due to a minification script that incorrectly handled certain JavaScript operators. This led to broken functionality in critical parts of the site, affecting around 3% of the user base, which accounted for 6% of revenue.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Bug Discovery</h4>
                    <p>Using analytics tools like GA4 and Matomo, we identified a recurring error affecting users with older Apple devices. A combination of user-agent string analysis and real-time testing on BrowserStack helped pinpoint the exact issue.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Testing and Reproduction</h4>
                    <p>The issue was reproduced by testing the site on older devices via BrowserStack. This confirmed that the minification script was auto-correcting the use of certain JavaScript operators (like the coalescence operator `??`) that caused compatibility issues.</p>

        <!-- Solution Section -->
        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>The minification script was updated to prevent the automatic correction of these specific operators for older browsers. By adding exceptions and adjusting the build process, we ensured that the code worked correctly for all users, regardless of their device or browser version.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>This debugging process highlighted the importance of comprehensive cross-browser and cross-device testing, especially when dealing with code optimizations like minification. It also reinforced the value of closely monitoring user feedback and error reports to catch issues early.</p>
