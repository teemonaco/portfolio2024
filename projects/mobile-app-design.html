        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The rise of digital content has transformed the way companies access and utilize information. In fast-paced industries where real-time insights are critical, the "InfoPro" mobile application was developed to empower stakeholders and researchers to access, save, share, and manage essential industry updates on the go. By streamlining the process of finding reliable information, the app ensures that users can stay ahead of the curve, mitigate risks, and make informed decisionsâ€”all from the convenience of their mobile devices.</p>

    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Stakeholders and researchers needed a reliable way to access and filter through large volumes of data and industry updates quickly. Existing solutions were cumbersome, with poor mobile interfaces that made it difficult to stay up-to-date while on the go, leading to a significant gap in timely information access.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Research & Discovery</h4>
                <p>We conducted interviews with target users to understand their daily workflows and the challenges they faced with existing tools. We also analyzed competitor apps to identify gaps in functionality and opportunities for differentiation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Wireframing & Prototyping</h4>
                <p>Based on our research, we developed low-fidelity wireframes focusing on ease of use and quick access to information. These wireframes evolved into high-fidelity prototypes, which were tested with users to refine interactions and ensure a smooth user experience.</p>

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>We designed and developed a mobile app that delivers real-time notifications, personalized content, and an intuitive search function, allowing users to quickly find relevant information. The app's design prioritized usability, with a clean interface and responsive design that adapts to different mobile devices.</p>
