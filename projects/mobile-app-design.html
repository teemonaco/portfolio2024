        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Mobile App project was initiated to provide stakeholders and researchers with a tool that allows them to stay informed about industry-related topics in real-time. Our goal was to design a seamless, intuitive mobile experience that delivers critical information efficiently, even when users are on the move.</p>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Stakeholders and researchers needed a reliable way to access and filter through large volumes of data and industry updates quickly. Existing solutions were cumbersome, with poor mobile interfaces that made it difficult to stay up-to-date while on the go, leading to a significant gap in timely information access.</p>

                <h4>Research & Discovery</h4>
                <p>We conducted interviews with target users to understand their daily workflows and the challenges they faced with existing tools. We also analyzed competitor apps to identify gaps in functionality and opportunities for differentiation.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Wireframing & Prototyping</h4>
                <p>Based on our research, we developed low-fidelity wireframes focusing on ease of use and quick access to information. These wireframes evolved into high-fidelity prototypes, which were tested with users to refine interactions and ensure a smooth user experience.</p>
