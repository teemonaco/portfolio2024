            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The checkout redesign was initiated to address a declining conversion rate and poor user experience in the final steps of the purchasing process. Our goal was to streamline the checkout process, reduce friction, and ultimately increase conversions.</p>

        <!-- Problem Section -->
        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Users were experiencing significant friction during the checkout process due to a cluttered interface, confusing input fields, and lack of mobile responsiveness. This resulted in a higher-than-average cart abandonment rate.</p>

                    <h4>Research & Discovery</h4>
                    <p>We conducted user interviews, analyzed heatmaps, and reviewed customer feedback to understand pain points. The data showed that users were dropping off at specific steps in the checkout process.</p>

                    <h4>Wireframing & Prototyping</h4>
                    <p>Based on our research, we created low-fidelity wireframes to simplify the checkout process. After several rounds of iteration, we developed high-fidelity prototypes for user testing.</p>
